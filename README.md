**Toward Language-independent Lip Reading: A Transfer Learning Approach at ISSCS21**


In this repository are available the lip reading subsets details used on experimental setup published at the 15-th International Symposium on Signals, Circuits and Systems.

For our experiments we have split the well-know datasets, like [LRW](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/publications/2016/Chung16/chung16.pdf), [LRW-1000](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.06990.pdf) and [LRRo](https://doi.org/10.1145/3339825.3394932 ) in two batches, based on the prediction difficulty> hard and hard+easy subset.
